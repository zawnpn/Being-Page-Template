# Interactive Demo Integration Complete! 🎉

The interactive demo component has been successfully integrated into your Being-Page-Template website. Here's everything you need to know:

## ✅ What's Been Added

1. **HTML Section**: Added to `index.html` after the video demonstrations section
2. **CSS Styles**: Added to `static/css/styles.css` with dark theme matching your design
3. **JavaScript Functionality**: Added to `static/js/script.js` with complete demo logic
4. **Folder Structure**: Created organized directories for your videos
5. **Step Limitation**: Configurable maximum steps per sequence (default: 3 steps)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Changing the Maximum Steps

To change the number of steps allowed per sequence, simply edit the `maxSteps` value in `static/js/script.js`:

```javascript
const demoData = {
    // Configuration
    maxSteps: 3, // Change this number to your desired maximum steps
    
    scenarios: {
        // ... rest of your scenarios
    }
};
```

For example:
- `maxSteps: 2` - Users can select 2 operations
- `maxSteps: 5` - Users can select 5 operations
- `maxSteps: 1` - Users can select only 1 operation

## 📁 Folder Structure Created

```
assets/
├── image/
│   └── scenarios/          # Put scenario thumbnail and initial images here
└── video/
    ├── kitchen/           # Kitchen scenario videos
    ├── bathroom/          # Bathroom scenario videos
    └── office/            # Office scenario videos
```

## 🎮 How the Demo Works

1. **User selects a scenario** from the thumbnail grid (Kitchen, Bathroom, Office)
2. **Initial image displays** showing the scenario's starting state
3. **User builds a sequence** by selecting operations step by step
4. **Each operation shows its video** immediately when selected
5. **Sequence tracker** shows the current list of selected operations
6. **Execute button** plays a demonstration of the complete sequence

## 🔧 How to Customize

### Adding Your Own Videos

1. **Replace placeholders**: Currently using `demo1.mp4` and `framework.png` as placeholders
2. **Add scenario thumbnails**: Put images in `assets/image/scenarios/`
3. **Add operation videos**: Organize by scenario in `assets/video/kitchen/`, etc.

### Updating the Data Structure

Edit the `demoData` object in `static/js/script.js`:

```javascript
const demoData = {
    scenarios: {
        kitchen: {
            name: "Kitchen",
            thumbnail: "assets/image/scenarios/kitchen_thumb.jpg",
            initialImage: "assets/image/scenarios/kitchen_initial.jpg",
            operations: {
                wash_hands: { name: "Wash hands", video: "assets/video/kitchen/wash_hands.mp4" },
                // Add more operations...
            }
        },
        // Add more scenarios...
    }
};
```

### Adding New Scenarios

Simply add a new entry to the `scenarios` object:

```javascript
garden: {
    name: "Garden",
    thumbnail: "assets/image/scenarios/garden_thumb.jpg",
    initialImage: "assets/image/scenarios/garden_initial.jpg",
    operations: {
        water_plants: { name: "Water plants", video: "assets/video/garden/water_plants.mp4" },
        pick_flowers: { name: "Pick flowers", video: "assets/video/garden/pick_flowers.mp4" }
    }
}
```

### Adding New Operations

Add to any scenario's `operations` object:

```javascript
pour_coffee: { name: "Pour coffee", video: "assets/video/kitchen/pour_coffee.mp4" }
```

## 🎨 Styling Customization

The demo uses your existing CSS variables and matches your website's design:

- **Colors**: Dark background with blue accents (`#2196F3`)
- **Fonts**: Uses your existing font stack
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Animations**: Smooth hover effects and transitions

## 📝 Current Demo Data

The demo currently includes:

**Kitchen Scenario:**
- Wash hands, Pick up bowl, Cut carrots, Dry hands, Wash bowl, Shut off water

**Bathroom Scenario:**
- Brush teeth, Wash face, Use towel, Apply soap

**Office Scenario:**
- Type on keyboard, Move mouse, Pick up pen, Open drawer

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the demo**: Open your website and try the interactive demo
2. **Replace placeholders**: Add your real images and videos
3. **Customize scenarios**: Update the data to match your research
4. **Add more content**: Expand with additional scenarios and operations

## 💡 Tips

- **Video format**: Use MP4 for best compatibility
- **Image sizes**: Thumbnails work best at 120x90px (4:3 aspect ratio)
- **File names**: Use descriptive names without spaces (use underscores)
- **Performance**: Optimize videos for web (compressed, reasonable quality)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Videos not loading**: Check file paths and ensure videos are in the correct folders
- **Demo not initializing**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Styling issues**: Ensure CSS was added correctly to `styles.css`

The interactive demo is now live on your website and ready for customization! 🎬✨
